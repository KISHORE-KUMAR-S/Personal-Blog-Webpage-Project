        <h1>SIERRA DE LA PLATA</h1>
        <p>Argentina is the southernmost country on Earth. Now, let us see the specialties of this country which has its own nature and traditional culture. </p>
        <p>This country is also called as "Sierra de la Plata", meaning "Silver Mountains" and there is also a story to be told. That is, in the 16th century, Portugal and Spaniards sailed in search of new lands. Then, they saw a mountain completely made of silver metal. The King who ruled Argentina was white in color, so he was called as White King. Although it is a myth, when this country was discovered, it was named after the Silver Mountain story. At that time, they named this country as "Argentum", an Italian word meaning "Silver".</p>

        <p>Due to the hard work of the people who migrated and settled here, this country became a prosperous country.  The capital of this country is Buenos Aires. It is a city of Old and New. Having been under the domination of Europe and Latin America for a long time, one can still see the cultural buildings and monuments of those countries here.</p>

Apart from that, music festivals are also celebrated. Traditional Tango dances are performed at the clubs here. Thus, the Buenos Aires is called as the Paris of South America.</p>
        <p>La Boca is a suburb. It was once inhabited by the Italians who emerged. They setup a tin shed and stayed in it. Working at a nearby shipyard, they applied the remaining paint to their tin shed homes, as well as to the roofs. Thus, tin houses painted in many colors began to appear in a different color.</p>
