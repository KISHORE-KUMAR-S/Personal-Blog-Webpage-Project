    <h1>NERVOUS SYSTEMS</h1>
    <p>If there is one thing that is so rare in the world?  Yes, it's Human Body. Each organs, and its functions are wonders that instill individual respect for the works. One of such wonders is our Nervous Systems.If you think that nerves are something like a hydraulic plastic tube, change your mind immediately. The Cerebral Cortex, aka Central Nervous System, and the Peripheral Nervous System are the two categories of Nervous Systems. A total of 43 pairs of veins are connected from the Central Nervous System. Out of these 43 pairs, 12 pairs of veins are attached to the brain and 31 pairs of veins run from spinal cord.</p>

    <p> A total length of 45 miles (approx. 72.4 km) of nerves are connected to each part of our body. We rely on the nerves for the five senses of touch, sight, taste, hear and smell. When we touch the hot vessel, the pain occurs in our skin is transmitted by the nerves to the brain. Then the brain issues orders to the particular area of the body to get away from it. All of this happen in a few micro-seconds. Like this, we can go on and on about the benefits of Nervous Systems.</p>
    <p>There are billions of nerve cells in the human body. It is no exaggeration to say that number of nerves in our body is greater than the number of human beings on Earth. The human brain alone has an average of 10 billion neurons. If these neurons are lined up, they can be up to 600 miles (approx. 965.6 km) apart. Similarly, there are more than 13 crore neurons in a 19 inch long spinal cord. The Nervous System transmits emotions at a speed of 100 m/s and a message at a speed of more than 175 km/hr. When the nerves are stretched with the blood vessels, the length of the nerves will be greater than the circumference of our Earth. This means that the nerves of the children can be stretched up to 60,000 miles (approx. 96560.64 km) and the nerves of the adults can be stretched up to 1,00,000 miles (approx. 160934.4 km).</p>
    <p>The total circumference of the Earth is 25,000 miles (approx. 40233.6 km) only. Thus, when the nerves are stretched, its length can bind the Earth like a bundle.</p>
