            <h1>POSTAGE STAMPS</h1><br>
            <p>Roland Hill (3 December, 1795 - 27 August, 1879), a native of England, suggested an idea of issuing of postage stamps, that the British Government could make a profit and compensate the Government for the loss of money at that time. But the United Kingdom Government initially did not accept the idea. Then, the UK Government accepted Roland Hill's idea and released a postage stamp with a portrait of Queen Victoria. The postage stamp was named as "Penny Black". It's price is One Penny.</p><br>

            <p> The UK Postal Service made a successful achievement. Then, the United States and Brazil subsequently issued the Postal Stamps. India is the first country in Asia to publish Postal Stamps. The Deputy Survey General of Calcutta designed the first Postal Stamp for India. At that time, the stamps were cut and used for sticking. Then, the stamps were designed with perforation for easy tearing. India was the first country to issue a postage stamp depicting Queen Victoria at Half Anna price. India is also the first Common Wealth country to issue Airmail Postage Stamps.</p>
            <p>After Independence, the Post Office held a competition for painters to draw postage stamps. Out of 1750 paintings drawn by the painters, the best 15 paintings were awarded after the Republic of India. The first stamp of Republic India was issued on November 21, 1947 depicting Indian flag with the patriotic slogan "JAI HIND", on the top right hand corner. It was valued 3 and 1/2 Annas. Mahatma Gandhiji is the first National Leader to be featured in Indian Postage Stamps. After Independence, the Government of India decided to issue the postage stamps depicting Mahatma Gandhiji on the eve of the next Independence Day. The postal stamps of Mahatma Gandhiji was printed by a Switzerland company as there was no proper technical facility in India at that time.</p>

            <p>In four variants, the image of Mahatma Gandhiji was printed at four different prices. These four stamps are still sold at high prices among postage stamp collectors.
